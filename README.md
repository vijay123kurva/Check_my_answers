# CheckMyAnswer
The evaluation of subjective answers has long been a challenge for educators, employers, and  researchers. CheckMyAnswer, powered by machine learning algorithms, 
has emerged as a  solution to this challenge.

Traditional methods of grading and assessment can be time-consuming, prone to human error. As 
a result, organizations may struggle to accurately assess the answers provided by employees or 
students, leading to suboptimal performance and decreased productivity. CheckMyAnswer 
provides a solution by automating the evaluation process and providing more accurate and 
efficient feedback.
